<h2>Important Concepts</h2>
<h3>World Wide Internet</h3>
<p></p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. 
When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends
a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document 
and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the
page and displays it on the user's screen. </p>
<p>1. You utilize a <b>brower</b> which runs a program on your computer to 
display files that make up the web.
<br>2. <b>HTTP</b> is the main protocol for the web.</br>3. <b>Servers</b> 
are computers that host files that make up the web.<br>4. <b>Internet</b> is
the world's largest computer network.</br> 
</p>
<h3>HTML - <em>The heart of the web!</em></h3>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority
of the content on the web

and is made up of the following: <br> <br>1. Text Content 
(what you see)</br>2. Mark up (what it looks like)<br>3. Reference to other 
documents (such as images and videos)</br> 4. Links to other pages</p>

<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
<p> HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type 
of each element by using HTML 
tags. It is very important to 
remember to open and close your tags so that your "tag" works properly.

<br></br>
<p>Some examples include: <br> <br>
1. <b>BOLD</b> <br>2. <em>Emphasis</em> <br>3.Image  <img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com

<h3>Why Computers are Stupid</h3>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program so it is very important to verify code while writing. 
</p>

<h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>

<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them. Inline tags include anchor, break, image, and strong while block tags include
  paragraph, form, and div.
